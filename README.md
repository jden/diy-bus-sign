============

print your own signage for your favorite bus stop

## Why

Many bus stops lack adequate signage for bus schedules. With thousands of bus stops, agencies lack
the resources to update signage in a timely fashion. What if there were an easy way for bus riders
and transit enthusiasts to print off & distribute schedules for their own bus stop. Transit
enthusiasts will be empowered to improve the bus stops they use most & help get timely, accurate
information to their fellow riders through the most accessible technology: paper.
